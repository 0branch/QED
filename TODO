TODO list
=========

Make putchar() `smarter' when printing in list mode: print non-printing
ASCII as \xHH, 16-bit Unicode as \uHHHH and 21-bit Unicode as \UHHHHHH.

uio: need more discipine in allocating uio-buffers to file descriptors.

blkio: the block/offset encoding is needlessly byzantine. Since each
block is now a block of ints (unicode codepoints), the file offsets of
each int will be aligned on 4-byte boundaries. Thus, the lowest order
2 bits are free. So, given address A, block(A) is A/BLKSIZE, and
offset(A) is ((A%BLOCKSIZE)&~03). An (unmarked) address is therefore
simply a file offset.

For a BLKSIZE which is a power of 2, div and mod are shift and mask
operations.
